# :dart: Bulls-Eye :dart:
A darts multi-player online platform where users can play in real time against other users around the globe!

# Libraries
<!-- Image Processing / Device Camera Access / Canvas Rendering -->
scikit-image  -> Python Image processor <br />
Tracking.js - > JavaScript Computer Vision on the web <br />
WebRTC -> Real-time Communication Between Browsers <br />
Three.js -> JavaScript 3D library

# Server
We need to decide between NodeJs or Python. This decision will be highly influenced by the technology language which is going to be responsible for image processing.

# Roadmap - 1.0 Version
1 - Access device camera through WebRTC and display the video on canvas. <-** We are here **-> <br />
2 - Understand what is the best technology/methodology to detect the dart board and the darts landing on it. <br />
3 - Design the board score matrix, so we can match the areas with the respective points. <br />
4 - Develop a minimal 501 single player game. <br />
5 - Create users accounts and a score board history <br />
6 - Multiplayer functionality <br />
